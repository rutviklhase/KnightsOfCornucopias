            The Knights of Cornucopias is a CNFT gaming guild for Cornucopias Game that is being built on the Cardano blockchain. As a guild, we have acquired a massive inventory of Cornucopias NFTs and have also created our own Knight NFTs that will have in-game utility as well as income potential. The Knights is not only the premier in-game Guild, we are also a positive community that advocates for players from all over the world. Join us and rise to the top of the metaverse as we build and grow together.
